# Practice ground to improve my C++ skills

> Learn C++ by solving mathematical/computer programming problems, implementing data structures and algorithms etc.

### Get Started with:
1. Solve problems mentioned in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) website.
   > Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

2. Implement data structures from [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/) website. It has a list of data sturctures listed, their explanations as well as C++ solution (which you can use to validate with your own solution).

3. _list to be updated..._
